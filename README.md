# from-apk-to-img

This tool, built thanks flask, allows to get an APK in input and converts it in image. The tool returns in output two kinds of images:

- grayscale image in png extension
- image in RGB in jpg extension 

The idea at the bottom of this tool is to get the dex file stored in APK, converting it into hexadecimal and convert the hex string in colors.
